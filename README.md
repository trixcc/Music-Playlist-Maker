## A Music Playlist Maker

#### What does this application do?
This application allows users to generate personalized music playlists.

#### Who can use this application?
This application is beneficial for music-lovers who like to stay organized.

#### Why is this project of interest to me?
I am interested in this project because I listen to a lot of different genres of music and tend to have all my
songs on one big playlist. Often times, a song will play that doesn't fit my mood.  
I want to create a simple-to-use application that can organize my music (eg. based on different moods).
